userCredentials contains connection credentials for connecting to Snowflake. Currently only basic auth (username/password) may be specified. If however, an OAuth connection has been established for the given environment specified in runDetails.environmentID, you may omit userCredentials. In that case, Coalesce will use the OAuth connection to connect with Snowflake.
